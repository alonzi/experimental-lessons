  * **Example 1** 
    * The first measurement has 20 MeV as error for the center value, which means expected true value can be located between 1806-2*20=1766 MeV/c^2 and 1806+2*20=1846 MeV/c^2 in 95% of time.

  * **Example 2** The difference between 1110 and 885.6 is around 225, which is 7 times larger than 30, the error of 1110.
