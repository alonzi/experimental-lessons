## Experimental Example
* [From "History of measurement"](https://www.quantumdiaries.org/2009/06/08/history-of-measurement/)

  * **Example 1 - left** 
    * The first measurement has 20 MeV as error for the center value, which means expected true value can be located between 1806-2*20=1766 MeV/c^2 and 1806+2*20=1846 MeV/c^2 in 95% of time. 
  * **Example 2 - right** 
    * The difference between 1110 and 885.6 is around 225, which is 7 times larger than 30, the error of 1110.
    
    
    
## Statistical Interpretation
* [Rules for normal data - left](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation#Rules_for_normally_distributed_data)
* [p-value - right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value#Definition_and_interpretation)

## Systematic Error
* [Dewey Defeats Truman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dewey_Defeats_Truman)

* [2016 US Election](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/09/why-2016-election-polls-missed-their-mark/)
  * One likely culprit is what pollsters refer to as nonresponse bias...certain kinds of people systematically do not respond to surveys.
